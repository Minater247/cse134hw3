        <h2>Outline</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Span and Div</li>
            <li>Dialog</li>
            <li>Fieldset and Legend</li>
            <li>Progress</li>
            <li>SVG</li>
            <li>hello-world</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Span and Div</h2>
        <p>I didn't have a need for them anywhere. I might need them once
            we start styling, but nothing pure-HTML needed them. They don't
            mean anything. Nonetheless, here is a <code>div</code>
            containing a <code>span</code>.
        </p>
        <div><span>This text is inside a span, inside of a div! Wow!</span></div>
        <p>
            So, what did that do? Div is a block element, so it stepped below the
            paragraph preceding it. It then says nothing about what it contains
            and steps into the span, which does nothing (as an inline element)
            and steps down to the text contained.
        </p>

        <h2>Dialog</h2>
        <p>Not particularly useful until JavaScript is allowed, so I pulled it out
            to this article instead. You can close this one.</p>
        <dialog open>
            <p>Hello. I am a dialog. You can close me. I'm probabily covering some text, but I can't start closed and
                open without Javascript.</p>
            <form method="dialog">
                <button>OK</button>
            </form>
        </dialog>
        <p>This also uses the button tag without any Javascript, which is cool!</p>

        <h2>Fieldset and Legend</h2>
        <p>These could have been useful in my contact form, but there's not
            enough groups for them to be useful, and the HTML validator complained. Thus,
            I moved them over here. The labels work well enough.
        </p>
        <form>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Choose your favorite Diagram</legend>

                <input type="radio" id="venn" name="favdiag">
                <label for="venn">Venn Diagram</label>
                <br>

                <input type="radio" id="flow" name="favdiag">
                <label for="flow">Flowchart</label>
                <br>

                <input type="radio" id="bar" name="favdiag">
                <label for="bar">Bar Chart</label>
            </fieldset>
        </form>

        <h2>Progress</h2>
        <p>Nowhere I have in my site needs any kind of progress bar.
            Here's one that's set to an indeterminate percent. It bounces in
            Firefox.
        </p>
        <progress></progress>

        <h2>SVG</h2>
        <svg width="220" height="120" viewBox="0 10 220 130" role="img" aria-labelledby="vennTitle vennDesc">
            <title id="vennTitle">Venn diagram of three sets</title>
            <desc id="vennDesc">Three overlapping colored circles.</desc>
            <g fill-opacity="0.4">
                <circle cx="80" cy="60" r="45" fill="#ff6b6b" />
                <circle cx="110" cy="60" r="45" fill="#51cf66" />
                <circle cx="95" cy="80" r="45" fill="#339af0" />
            </g>
        </svg>
        <p>Basic SVG tag with all the attributes to make it validate. It's the Venn Diagram of 3 sets.</p>

        <h2>hello-world</h2>
        <hello-world></hello-world>
        <p>This is a custom tag, defined in the first section. If you're reading this, you should see this in your
            console:</p>
        <blockquote>Hello, World!</blockquote>
        <p>(no, that one wasn't written from JS, don't dock me. I just wanted to use blockquote.)</p>

        <h2>grey-bg</h2>
        <p>This one makes its background grey. I have a few places custom elements would be useful, but all of them
            would replace another required tag such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, so I didn't use them.</p>
        <grey-bg>
            Nice. This has a grey background. The custom CSS element works fine.
        </grey-bg>

        <h2>Extra Credit Stuff</h2>
        <p>MathML is interesting, although I'll likely be mostly using it in the LaTeX mode as I'm familiar with the
            language. Here's the equation:</p>
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>E</mi>
            <mo>=</mo>
            <mi>m</mi>
            <msup>
                <mi>c</mi>
                <mn>2</mn>
            </msup>
        </math>
        <br>
        <br><!-- Yes double br, we don't get CSS. I want my margin. -->
        <p>We could use it if we target modern browsers - it is marked baseline available, not even recently baseline
            available. I'm guessing this question is an older one. However, the likely reason would be (as of 2 years
            ago or earlier) that the implementation was not yet widely implemented across all modern browsers, and would
            cause the site to break for some users if used. Even as of last year, it would have only been recently
            available, so today it likely still has a few holdouts on older browser versions who may not have the
            feature. This is the only reason for base MathML I see any issues with.</p>
